The charge in respect of urban immoveable property tax created by the Bombay Finance Act, 1939 is similar in character and the amount of such charge should also be deducted.","The expression ""capital charge"" in s.9(1) (iv) means a charge created for a capital sum,that is to say, a charge created to. ' secure the discharge of a liability of a capi tal nature; and an ""annual charge"" means a charge to secure an annual liabili ty. 554",,1949,

Where an officer as a District Magistrate exercising his powers under section 7(1) of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, sanctioned the prosecution of a person for violation of sections 3 and 7 of the Assam Food Grains Control Order, 1947, and the same officer as Additional District Magistrate tried and convicted the accused, and it was contended that as the officer had given sanction for prosecution he was ""personally interested"" in the case within the meaning of section 656, Criminal Procedure Code, and the trial and conviction were therefore illegal: Held, that bymerely giving sanction for prosecution he did not become personally interested"" in the case and the trial and conviction were not illegal.","In both cases of sanction and direction to prosecute, an application of the mind is necessary, but there is this essential difference that in the one case there is a legal impediment to the prosecution if there is no sanction and in the other case there is a positive order that the prosecution should be launched. For a sanction, all that is necessary for one to be satisfied about is the existence of a prima facie case. In the case of a direction, a further element that the accused deserves to be prosecuted is involved. Whether sanction should be granted or not may conceivably depend considerations extraneous to the merits of the case. But where a prosecution is directed, it means that the authority who gives the sanction is satisfied in his own mind that the case must be initiated. Sanction is in the nature of a permission, while direction is in the nature of a command. Gokulchand Dwarka Das vs The King , Government of Bengal vs Heera Lall Dass and Others (1872) 17 W. R.

3,The appellant was a member of a joint Hindu family which carried on the business,police_related,"The appellant was a member of a joint Hindu family which carried on the business of Government stockists of grain under a contract with the Government of Bihar. His nomination for election to the Bihar Legislative Assembly was rejected on the ground that he was disqualified under section 7(d) of the Representation of the People Act, 195T, as he had an interest in a contract for the performance of services undertaken by the Bihar Government.","The appellant contended that the service undertaken by the Government was the sale of foodgrains under the Grain Supply Scheme and the contract was not for the sale of such foodgrains and did not attract the provisions of section 7(d). Held, that the contract was not one for the performance of any service undertaken by the Government and the appellant was not disqualified under section 7(d). A contract of bailment which imposed on the bailee the obligation to stock and store the foodgrains in his godowns was not a contract for the purpose of the service of sale of grain which the Government had undertaken. The Government had undertaken the work of supplying grain but the contract was not one for the supply of grain. N. Satyanathan vs K. Subramanyam, ; and V. V.

4,"The appellant, who was working as a Loco Foreman, was found to have accepted a s",police_related,"The appellant, who was working as a Loco Foreman, was found to have accepted a sum of Rs. 375 from a Railway Contractor.","The appellant 's explanation was that he had borrowed the amount as he was in need of money for meeting the expenses of the clothing of his children who were studying in school, The Special judge accepted the evidence of the contractor and held that the money had been taken as a bribe, that the defence story was improbable and untrue, that the presumption under section 4 Of the Prevention of Corruption Act had to be raised and that the presumption had not been rebutted by the appellant and accordingly convicted him under section 161 Indian Penal Code and section 5 Of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. On appeal the High Court held that on the facts of the case the statutory presumption under section 4 had to be raised, that the explanation offered by the appellant was improbable and palpably unreasonable and that the presumption had not been rebutted, and upheld the conviction. The appellant contended (i) that section 4 was ultra vires as it contravened article 14 of the Constitution, (ii) that the presumption under section 4 could not be raised merely on proof of acceptance of money but it had further to be proved that the money was accepted as a bribe, (iii) and that even if the presumption arose it was rebutted when the appellant offered a reasonably probable explanation. Held, that section 4 of the Prevention of Corruption Act did not violate article 14 Of the Constitution. The classification of public servants who were brought within the mischief of section 4 was based on intelligible differentia which had a rational relation to the object of the Act, viz,, eradicating bribery and corruption amongst public servants.

The presumption under section 4 arose when it was shown that the accused had received the stated amount and that the said amount was not legal remuneration. The word "" gratification ' 593 in section 4(1) was to be given its literal dictionary meaning of satisfaction of appetite or desire ; it could not be construed to mean money paid by way of a bribe. The High Court was justified in raising the presumption against the appellant as it was admitted that he had received the money from the contractor and the amount received was other than legal remuneration.

Even if it be assumed that the presumption arising under section 4(1) could be rebutted by the accused giving an explanation which was a reasonably probable one the High Court was right in holding that the explanation given by the appellant was wholly unsatisfactory and unreasonable.

5,During the search of the premises of the appellant No.,police_related,During the search of the premises of the appellant No. 1 a complete working still was found which was being worked by the appellant No.,"1 and his servant, appellant No. 2. The presidency Magistrate was satisfied that a working still and 516 illicit liquor were found. The appellant No. 1 was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, he volunteered the statement that he did not know anything of the contraband seized by the police ; so no specific question about the still and other articles recovered from his premises were put by the Presidency Magistrate who convicted the appellants under sections 65(b), 65(f) & 66(b) of the Bombay Prohibition Act, relying on the facts of the recovery of still and illicit liquor and did not use the provision of section 103 for presumption against the appellants. The appellants on appeal by special leave contended, (1) that no presumption under section 103 of the Act could arise ; and that he had been denied the opportunity to rebut the presumption under section 103 of the Act, as no questions were put to them when they were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (3) that as the Magistrate had not used the provision of section 103 for presumption against the appellants, the High Court ought not to have convicted the appellants on the presumption arising under section 103 of the Act without giving them an opportunity to rebut the same. On behalf of appellant No. 2 it was further urged that he was merely a servant of appellant No. 1; if any one was in possession of the still it was appellant No. 1 and no presumption against him could arise under section 103 of the Act. Held, that when an accused is examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and volunteers statement denying all knowledge of articles recovered from his possession, no prejudice is caused to him if no further questions are put to explain the possession of articles found in the premises occupied by him. The presumption which arises under section 103 of the Bombay Prohibition Act is that an offence under the Act is committed when a person is found in mere possession, without further evidence, of any still, utensil, implement or apparatus whatsoever for the manufacture of such intoxicant until contrary is proved. Thus no prejudice was caused to the appellant No. 1 when the High Court relied upon the presumption arising under section 103 of the Act to uphold his conviction under section 65(f) of the Act. Held, further, that it cannot be said of merely an employee in the premises that he was in physical possession of the things belonging to his master unless they were left in his custody, Where an offence under section 65(f) of the Bombay Prohibition Act has not been established beyond reasonable doubt and the possession of still does not amount to an offence under the section no presumption could arise under section 103 of the Act against a person that he was in possession of the still for which he could not account satisfactorily. In the instant case the still being in the possession of the master and there being no evidence that the employee in any 517 way aided his master to come into possession of the still, it could not be said that the appellant No. 2 was in such possession of the still as would amount to an offence under section 65(f) of the Act.",,1959,

On appeal by a certificate of the High Court, Held, that the interim order passed by the tribunal reinsta ting the respondent was erroneous. Such an interim relief could not be given by the Tribunal as it would amount to prejudging the respondents ' case and granting him the whole relief at the outset without deciding the legality of his dismissal after hearing the appellant employer.

7,The petitioners challenged the constitutional validity of the Orissa Mining Area,police_related,"The petitioners challenged the constitutional validity of the Orissa Mining Areas Development Fund Act, 1952, which by section 3 empowered the State Government to constitute mining areas for the purpose of providing them with certain amenities after hearing objections from the lessees, by section 4 to impose and collect a cess not exceeding 5% of the valuation of the minerals at the pit 's mouth and by section 5 created a fund to which the cess was to be credited. The petitioners ' case, inter alia, was that the impugned Act and the rules made thereunder were ultra vires the powers of the State Legislature, the cess levied thereunder was not a fee but a duty of excise on coal within Entry 84 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and repugnant to Coal Mines Labour Welfare Fund Act, 1947 (Act XXXII of 1947), and, alternatively, even supposing it was a fee relatable to Entries 23 and 66 of List II, it was hit by Entry 54 of List I read with the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act 1948 (Act LIII of 1948), or by Entry 52 of List I read with the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 (Act LXV of 1951).","It was urged on behalf of the State, inter alia, that the cess was a fee and not a duty of excise and the competence of the State Legislature to levy it was not affected by the Central Acts. Held (per Gajendragadkar, Sarkar, Subba Rao and Mudholkar, JJ.), that the cess imposed by the Act was a fee relatable to Entries 23 and 66 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and the Constitutional validity of the impugned Act was beyond question. Although there can be no generic difference between a tax and a fee since both are compulsory exactions of money by public authorities, there is this distinction between them that whereas a tax is imposed for public purposes and requires no consideration to support it, a fee is levied essentially for services rendered and there must be an element of quid pro quo between the person 538 who pays it and the public authority that imposes it. While a tax invariably goes into the consolidated fund, a fee is earmarked for the specified services in a fund created for the purpose. Whether a cess is one or the other would naturally depend on the facts of each case. If in the guise of a fee, the Legislature imposes a tax, it is for the Court on a scrutiny of the scheme of the levy, to determine its real character. The distinction is recognised by the Constitution which while empowering the appropriate Legislatures to levy taxes under the Entries in the three lists refers to their power to levy fees in respect of any such matters, except the fees taken in court, and tests have been laid down by this Court for determining the character of an impugned levy. Matthews vs Chicory Marketing Board, ; , The Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras vs Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt, ; , Mahant Sri Jagannath Ramanuj Das & Any. vs The State of Orissa, ; , and Ratilal Panachand Gandhi vs The State of Bombay, [1954] S.C.R. 1055, referred to. P. P. Kutti Keva & Ors. vs The State of Madras, A.I.R. , Attorney General for British Columbia vs Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Co., and Parton & Any. vs Mils Board (Victoria), (1949) 80 C.L.R. 229, considered and held inapplicable. In determining whether a levy is a fee the true test must be whether its primary and essential purpose is to render specific services to a specified area or class, it being of no consequence that the State may ultimately and indirectly be benefited by it. So judged, the scheme of the impugned Act leaves no manner of doubt that the levy authorised by it is a fee and not a tax. The amount of the levy must depend on the extent of the services sought to be rendered and if they are proportionate, it would be unreasonable to say that since the impost is high it must be a duty of excise. The rate specified by section 4(2) of the Act, therefore, cannot by itself alter the character of the levy and constitute a trespass by the State Legislature on the legislative powers of the Parliament under Entry 84 of the List I. Nor can the method prescribed by the Legislature for re covering the levy by itself alter its character. The method is a matter of convenience and, though relevant, has to be tested in the light of other relevant circumstances. It is not permissible to challenge the vires of a statute relatable to an Entry in List II solely on the ground that the method adopted for the recovery of the impost can and generally is adopted in levying a duty of excise. Ralla Ram vs The Province of East Punjab, , Byramjee Jeejeebhoy vs The Province of Bombay & Anr. I.L.R. 539 and Governor General in Council vs Province of Madras, (1945) 'L.R. 72 I.A. 91, considered. The limitation imposed by the latter part of Entry 23 of List II is a limitation on the legislative competence of the State ' Legislature itself and the test whether a statute passed by the State Legislature thereunder was ultra vires would be whether the requisite declaration under Entry 54, List I, has been made by Parliament by law covering the same field or not; it is not necessary in order to make the declaration effective that rules should also be made and enforced. Although by operation of article 372 of the Constitution Act LIII of 1948 was an existing Act substantially covering the same field as covered by the impugned Act, there was no adaptation of section 2 of that Act whereby a declaration implied by it could be said to have been adapted to a declaration by Parliament. Clause 16 of the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950, properly construed, cannot be held to refer to the Dominion Legislature and equate it with the Parliament. It can be resorted to only where the existing law expressly refers to some authority that can be equated with the corresponding new authorities. Since the Dominion Legislature was not so referred to, its competence under the Constitution Act of 1935, repealed by the Constitution of India, was clearly outside the clause. Nor can Cl. 21 of the order be of any help to the petitioners. Consequently, in the absence of the requisite Parliamentary declaration, the competence of the Orissa State Legislature under Entry 23 read with Entry 66 of the List II was not impaired and the impugned Act must be deemed to have repeal ed the Central Act, so far as that State was concerned. This case incidentally discloses that in regard to the requisite Parliamentary declaration prescribed by Entry 54 in List I in its application to the pre constitution Acts under corresponding Entry 36 in List I of the Constitution Act of 1935, there is a lacuna which has not been covered by any clauses of the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950. Nor was the impugned Act ultra vires the State Legislature by operation of Entry 52 of List I read with section 2 of the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 (LXV of 1951). That Act, in pith and substance, deals more directly with the control of certain specified industries including the coal industry, while the impugned Act is concerned with the development of the mining areas notified under it. The field covered by the two Acts was not, therefore, the same. per Wanchoo, J. In order to determine whether a levy is a tax or a fee, what has to be considered is the pith and sub stance of the levy. Where the levy in pith and substance is not essentially different from a tax, it cannot be converted into a fee by crediting it to a special fund and attaching certain services to it. 540 The Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras, vs Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt, ; , Mahant Sri Jaannath Ramanuj Das vs The State of Orissa, ; and Ratilal Panachand Gandhi vs The State of Bombay, [1954] S.C.R. 1055, discussed. A duty of excise in pith and substance is primarily a duty levied on a manufacturer or producer in respect of the commodity manufactured or produced. It is different and distinct from a sales tax and in law they do not overlap. Governor General in Council vs Province of Madras, 72 I.A. 91, referred to. What the impugned Act did was to provide for the levying of the cess on the goods produced at a rate not exceeding five per centum of the value at the pit 's mouth. The cess was, therefore, in pith and substance a duty of excise falling within Entry 84 of List I, which the State legislature could not levy. It was not correct to say that the method employed by the impugned Act for realising the cess was a mere method of quantification and did not affect its character which was that of a fee. In the present case the very mode of the levy of the cess is nothing other than the levy of a duty of excise, and, therefore, the principle of quantification for purposes of a fee could not be so extended as to convert what was in pith and substance a tax into a fee.

8,The appellants were shareholders of a company known as Navjivan Mills Ltd.,police_related,The appellants were shareholders of a company known as Navjivan Mills Ltd. which held a large number of shares of the Bank of India.,"The Bank with the object of increasing their share capital offered some more shares to the Mills for a price including premium which was about half the market value. The Mills purchased a small number of the shares so offered with their own funds and distributed their right to acquire the remaining shares to their shareholders in the proportion of two shares of the Bank for one share held by them. The assessment of the appellant was reopened by the Income Tax Officer under section 34(1)(a) of the Income tax Act on the footing that the release of the right to the shares of the Bank of India amounted to distribution of dividend. Appeals against the order of the Income Tax Officer having failed, the High Court at the instance of the appellants framed the following question: ""Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the distribution of the right to apply for the shares of the Bank of India by Navjivan Mills Ltd. in favour of the assessees amounted to a distribution of ""dividend""? 585 The High Court answered the question in the affirmative. On appeal with a certificate of the High Court, Held, that the view taken by the High Court was correct. The distribution to the shareholders of the Mills of the right to obtain two shares of the Bank of India for each share held by them at half the market value amounted to distribution of ""dividend"" which was liable to be taxed.",,1957,
9,The appellants were detained under r.,police_related,"The appellants were detained under r. 30(l) of the Defence of India Rules made by the Central Government under section 3 of the Defence of India Ordinance, 1962.","They applied to the Punjab and Bombay High Courts under section 491(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and their case was that sections 3(2)(15)(i) and 40 of the Defence of India Act, 1962, and r. 30(1)(b) of the Defence of India Rules, which were continued under the Act, were unconstitutional and invalid inasmuch as they contravened their fundamental rights under articles 14, 21, 22(4), (5) and (7) of the Constitution and that, therefore, they should be set at liberty. The High Courts held that the Presidential Order which had been issued on November 3, 1962, under article 359(1) of the Constitution, after a declaration of emergency under article 352, consequent on the Chinese invasion of India, barred their right to move the said petitions and dismissed them. These appeals raised two common questions in this Court, (1) what was the true scope and effect of the Presidential Order issued under article 359(1), and (2) did the bar created by the Order operate in respect of the applications under section 491(1)(b) of the Code. The Presidential Order was as follows: ""G.S.R. 1464 In exercise of the powers conferred by cl. (1) of article 359 of the Constitution, the President hereby declares that the right of any person to move any court for the enforcement of the right conferred by article 21 and article 22 of the Constitution shall remain suspended for the period during which the Proclamation of Emergency issued under clause (1) of article 352 thereof on the 26th October 1962 is in force, if such person has been deprived of any such rights under the Defence of India Ordinance, 1962 (4 of 1962) or any rule or order made thereunder. "" By a later amendment of the Order article 14 was incorporated into it. 798 Held:(per Gajendragadkar, Sarkar, Wanchoo, Hidayatullah, Das Gupta and Shah, JJ.) that the proceedings taken by the appellants in the High Courts under section 491(1)(b) of the Code were hit by the Presidential Order and must be held to be incompetent. Article 359 of the Constitution was not capable of two interpretations and it was, therefore not necessary to decide the controversy raised by the parties as to whether that Article should be interpreted in favour of the President 's power granted by it or the fundamental rights of the citizens. The King (At the Prosecution of Arthur Zadig) vs Halliday, ; , Liversidge vs Sir John Anderson, ; , Keshav Talpade vs The King Emperor, [1943] F.C.R. 49, Nakkuda Ali vs M. F. De section Jayaratne, and King Emperor vs Vimalabal Deshpande, L.R. 73 1. A. 144, considered. The words 'any court ' in article 359(1), construed in their plain grammatical meaning, must mean any court of competent jurisdiction including ' the Supreme Court and the High Courts before which the rights specified in the Presidential Order can be enforced. It was not correct to say that the use of the words was necessary so as to include such other courts as might be empowered in terms of article 32(3). Nor was it correct to say that the words could not include a High Court as its power to issue a writ under article 226(1) was discretionary. In judging whether a particular proceeding fell within the purview of the Presidential Order the determining factor was not its form nor the words in which the relief was couched but the substance of it. If in granting the relief the court had to consider whether any of the fundamental rights mentioned in the Presidential Order, had been contravened, the proceeding was within the Order, whether it was under article 32(l) or 226(1) of the Constitution. The right to move the court for writ of habeas corpus under section 491(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was now a statutory right and could no longer be claimed under the common law. Girindra Nath Banerjee vs Birendra Nath Pal I.L.R. 54 Cal. 727, District Magistrate, Trivandrum vs K. C. Mammen Map pillai, I.L.R. , Matthen vs District Magistrate, Trivandrum L.R. 66 I.A. 222 and King Emperor vs Sibnath Banerji, L.R. 72 I.A. 241, referred to. Since the promulgation of the Constitution the two methods by which a citizen could enforce his right of personal freedom were (i) by a writ under article 226(1) or article 32(l), or (ii) under section 491(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Whichever method he adopted if the right he sought to enforce was a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution the matter must, come within article 359(1) of the Constitution. That the court could exercise its power under section 491(1)(b) suo motu could make no 799 difference and articles 372, 225 or 375 could provide no valid ground of attack. The suspension of the right to move any court, as under the Presidential Order, must necessarily suspend the Court 's jurisdiction accordingly. The right to challenge a detention order under section 491(1)(b) of the Code had been enlarged by the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and when a detenu relied upon such rights in his petition under that section he was in substance seeking to enforce his fundamental rights. The prohibition contained in article 359(1) and the Presidential Order must, therefore, apply. The expression ""right to move any court"" in article 359(1) and the Presidential Order takes in all legal actions, filed or to be filed, in which the specified rights are sought to be enforced and covers all relevant categories of jurisdictions of competent courts under which the said actions would other wise have been normally entertained and tried. Sree Mohan Chowdhury vs Chief Commissioner Union Territory of Tripura, ; , referred to. Even though the impugned Act may be invalid by reason of contravention of articles 14, 21 and 22, as contended by the appellants, that invalidity could not be challenged during the period prescribed by the Presidential Order and it could not be said that the President could not because of such invalidity issue the order. Where, however, the challenge to the validity of the detention order was based on any right other than those mentioned in the Presidential Order, the detenu 's right to move any court could not be suspended by the Presidential Order because the right was outside article 359(1). Where again the detention was challenged on the ground that it contravened the mandatory provisions of the relevant act or that it was malafide and was proved to be so and in all cases falling under the other categories of section 491(1) of the Code excepting those under section 491(1)(b), the bar of the Presidential Order could have no application. So also the plea that the operative provision of the law under which the order of detention was made suffered from the vice of excessive delegation, was an independent plea not relatable to the fundamental rights mentioned in the Presidential Order and its validity had to be examined. The plea that section 3(2)(15)(i) and section 40 of the impugned Act suffered from excessive delegation must fail. The legislative policy was broad stated in the preamble and the relevant provisions of sections 3(1) and 3(2) gave detailed and specific guidance to the rule making authority and it was not correct to say that the Act had by the impugned sections delegated essentially legislative function to that authority. Rule 30(1)(b) which was consistent with the operative provisions of the Act could not also be challenged on that ground. 800 In "" The etc. ; , Harishankar Bagla vs The State of Madhya Pradesh, , Bhatanagars and Co. Ltd., vs The Union of India, ; , relied on. The impugned Act could not also he struck down as a piece of colourable legislation because the , was already on the Statute book. The Parliament had power under Entry 9, List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and if in view of the grave threat to the security of India it passed the Act, it could not be said to have acted malafide. If the Parliament thought that the executive would not be able to detain citizens reasonably suspected of prejudicial activities by a recourse to the , which provided for the required constitutional safeguards and the impugned Act which it enacted did not, it could not be suggested that it was acting malafide. Even if the impugned Act contravened articles 14 and 22 and the detentions thereunder were invalid, article 359(1) and the Presidential Order, which were precisely meant to meet such a situation, barred investigation on the merits during the period prescribed by the Order. The proceeding under section 491(1)(b) of the Code is one pro ceeding and the sole relief that can be claimed under it is release from the detention. If that could not be claimed because of the Presidential Order it was unreasonable to say that a mere declaration that the impugned Act and the detention thereunder were invalid could be made. Such a declaration is clearly outside the purview of section 491(1)(b) of the Code as also of articles 226(1) and 32(l) of the Constitution. The period for which the emergency should continue and the restrictions that should be imposed during its continuance are matters that must inevitably be left to the executive. In a democratic state the effective safeguard against any abuse of power in peace as also in emergency is the existence of enlightened, vigilant and vocal public opinion. Liversidge vs Sir John Anderson, [19421 A.C. 206, referred to. The inviolability of individual freedom and the majesty of law that sustains it are equally governed by the Constitution which has made this Court the custodian of the fundamental rights on the one hand and, on the other, provided for the declaration of the emergency. Consequently, in dealing with the right of a citizen to challenge the validity of his detention, effect must be given to article 359(1) and the Presidential Order issued under it. The right specified in that Article must be held to include such right whether constitutional or constitutionally guaranteed and the words ""any court"" must include the Supreme Court and the High Court. The Punjab and the Bombay High Courts were, therefore right in their decision that the applications under section 491(1)(b) of 801 the Code were incompetent in so far as they sought to challenge the validity of the detentions on the ground that the Act and the Rules under which the orders were made contravened articles 14, 21 and 22(4)(5) and (7) of the Constitution. Per Subba Rao, J. It was clear that section 3(2)(15)(i) of the Defence of India Act, 1962, and r. 30(1)(b) made under the Act contravened the relevant provisions of article 22 of the Constitution and were, therefore, void.

Under the Constitution, every person has a right to move the Supreme Court, the High Courts or any other court or courts constituted by the Parliament under article 32(3) for the enforcement of fundamental rights in the manner prescribed. But while the right to move the Supreme Court is a guaranteed right, the right to move the others is not so. Article 359, properly construed, meant that the bar imposed by the Presidential Order applied not only to the guaranteed right to move the Supreme Court but also the rights to move the other courts under article 32 and article 226 of the Constitution. There is no new rule of construction peculiar to war measures. It is always the same, whether in peace or in war. The fundamental rule is that the courts have to find out the expressed intention of the Legislature from the words of the enactment itself. Words must be given their natural and ordinary meaning unless there is ambiguity in the language in which case the court has to adopt that meaning which furthers the intention of the Legislature. A constitutional provision such as article 359, however, cannot be given a strained construction to meet a passing phase such as the present emergency. Rex vs Halliday, L.R. [19171 A.C. 260, Liversidge vs Sir John Anderson; , , Nakkuda A1i vs jayaratna, , Gibbon vs Ogden, (1824) 6 L. Ed. 23, discussed. Section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is wide in its terms and gives a discretionary power to the High Courts. Unlike articles 32 and 226, the exercise of the power is not channelled through procedural writs or orders and their technicalities cannot circumscribe the court 's discretion. Girindra Nath Banerjee vs Birendra Nath Pal, (1927) I.L.R. , District Magistrate, Trivandrum vs Mammen Mappillai, I.L.R. , Matten vs District Magistrate, Trivandrum, L.R. (1939) 66 I.A. 222, referred to. Section 491 is continued by article 372 and article
225 preserves 802 the jurisdiction of the High Court. The power it confers on the High Court is not inconsistent either with article 32 or article 226 or any other Article of the Constitution and the section cannot, therefore, be said to have been impliedly superseded even to the extent article 226 empowers the High Court to give relief in cases of illegal detention. Though remedial in form the section postulates the existence of the substantive right that no person can be deprived of his liberty except in the manner prescribed by law. It assumes the existence of the rule of law and empowers High Court to act suo motu. The rights, substantive and procedural conferred by it arc different from those under articles 32 or 226 of the Constitution. It places the onus on the custodian to prove that the detention is legal and although in scrutinising the legality of the detention the court may have to consider whether the law offends any fundamental rights, that cannot make the proceeding one for the enforcement of fundamental rights or the decision anything but one on the unconstitutionality of a law because of infringement of fundamental rights generally. The mode of approach to the High Court under section 491 of the Code or the nature of the relief given thereunder cannot be equated with those under the Constitution. The absolute discretionary jurisdiction under it cannot be put on a par with the jurisdiction under article 226 which is hedged in by constitutional limitations. Alam Khan vs The Crown, Lahore 274, Ramji Lal vs The Crown, I.L.R. (1949) 11 E.P. 28, King Emperor vs Vimlabai Deshpande, (1946) L.R. 73 I.A. 144, referred to. While section 491 gives no right to enforce fundamental rights, operating as it does as a check on arbitrary action, article 359 is concerned not with statutory powers but deals with the constitutional right and the constitutional enforcement of it. It was not, therefore, correct to say that article 359 would be frustrated if section 491 was allowed to stand for Parliament might amend that section any time it liked. The expression ""right to move any court for enforcement of such of the rights conferred by Part 111"" in article 359 must refer only to the right to move under article 32 or article 226 for the said specific relief and could not be applied to the exercise of the statutory power of the High Courts under section 491 of the Code and, consequently, the expression ""all proceedings pending in any court for the enforcement of the rights"" must refer to the proceedings initiated in exercise of that right. The detenus could not, therefore, enforce their fundamental rights under articles 21, 32 and 14 while the Presidential Order lasted, but that did not affect the High Court 's power under section 491 of the Code. The President 's Order cannot bar the detenus from proving even under articles 32(l) and 226 that the detentions were not made 803 under the Defence of India Ordinance or the Act as they were outside the Ordinance or the Act or in excess of the power conferred by them or that the detentions were made malafide or in fraudulent exercise of power.",,1963,

After the acquisition, the proprietor of the Estate was granted abatement of land revenue assessed on the Estate to the extent of Rs.","386 7 1, being the proportionate land revenue on the land acquired.

Romesh Thapar 's case ([1950] 655 S.C.R.,"594]) and Brij Bhushan 's case ([1950] S.C.R. 605)do not lay down any wide proposition that restrictions of the nature imposed by section 4 (1) (a) are outside the scope of article 19 (2) as they are conceived generally in the interests of public order.

Proceedings under section 7 of the Police Act were taken against the respondent on the charge of misappropriation of Rs. 250 and he was dismissed from service by an order of the Deputy Inspector General of Police. The respondent filed a writ petition before the High Court challenging the order of the dismissal on the ground that the authorities had acted in violation of Rule I of Para. 486 of the U. P.

This rule required that every information received by the police relating to the commission of a cognizable offence by a Police Officer shall be dealt with in the first place under Ch. XIV, Code of Criminal Procedure. The High Court held that the provisions of para. 486 of the Police Regulations had not been observed and that the proceedings taken under section 7 of the Police Act were invalid and illegal and accordingly quashed the order of dismissal. The appellant contended (i) that the complaint did not make out any cognizable offence against the respondent and r. I of Para. 486 was not applicable in this case, (ii) that r. III of Para. 486 enabled the authorities to initiate departmental proceedings without complying with the provisions of r. I, (iii) that the Police Regulations made in exercise of the power conferred on the Government under the Police Act delegating the power of the Governor to dismiss at pleasure to a subordinate officer were only administrative directions for the exercise of the pleasure in a reasonable manner and any breach of the regulations did not confer any right or give a cause of action to the public servant, and (iv) that the regulations were only directory and the non compliance with the rules did not invalidate the order of dismissal. 680 Held, (per Sarkar, Subba Rao and Mudholkar, JJ.) that the order of dismissal was illegal as it was based upon an enquiry held in violation of r. I of Para 486 of the Police Regulations. The facts alleged in the complaint made out a cognizable offence under section 405 Indian Penal Code against the respondent, and the provisions of r. I of Para . 486 were applicable to it. A Police Officer making a search of a person was 'entrusted ' with the money handed over by the person searched. Rule III of Para. 486 did not deal with cognizable offences, it dealt with offences falling only under section 7 Police Act and to non cognizable offences. Rule III did not provide an alternative procedure to that prescribed under r. I. The position with regard to the tenure of public servants and to the taking of disciplinary action against them under the present Constitution was as follows: (i) Every person who was a member of a public service described in article 310 of the Constitution held office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor. (ii) The power to dismiss a public servant at pleasure was outside the scope of article I54 and, therefore, could not be delegated by the Governor to a subordinate officer, and could be exercised by him only in the manner prescribed by the Constitution. (iii) This tenure was subject to the limitations or qualifi cations mentioned in article 311. (iv )Parliament or the Legislature of States could not make a law abrogating or modifying this tenure so as to impinge upon the overriding power conferred upon the President or the Governor under article 310, as qualified by article 311. (v) Parliament or the Legislatures of States could make a law regulating the conditions of service of such a member which included proceedings by way of disciplinary action, without affecting the powers of the President or the Governor under article 310 read with article 311. (vi) Parliament and the Legislatures also could makea law laying down and regulating the scope and content of the doctrine of ""reasonable opportunity"" embodied in article 311 but the said law was subject to judicial review. (vii) If a statute could be made by Legislatures within the foregoing permissible limits, the rules made by an authority in exercise of the power conferred thereunder would likewise be efficacious within the said limits.

Whether it was delegation by the Governor himself or whether it was delegation by law under article 154(2)(b) or by the existing law, which must be treated as analogous to a law under article 154(2)(b), the officer exercising the power of dismissal was only indirectly exercising the Governor 's power to dismiss at pleasure.

24,The respondent was a sub Inspector of Police.,police_related,The respondent was a sub Inspector of Police. A complaint was received by the Superintendent of Police that the com plainant was carrying currency notes of Rs.,"650 in a bundle when he was stopped by the respondent and his person was searched, that the respondent opened the bundle of notes and handed over the notes one by one to one Lalji, who was with him and that Lalji returned the notes to him but on reaching home he found the notes short by Rs. 250. Proceedings under section 7 of the Police Act were taken against the respondent on the charge of misappropriation of Rs. 250 and he was dismissed from service by an order of the Deputy Inspector General of Police. The respondent filed a writ petition before the High Court challenging the order of the dismissal on the ground that the authorities had acted in violation of Rule I of Para. 486 of the U. P. Police Regulation. This rule required that every information received by the police relating to the commission of a cognizable offence by a Police Officer shall be dealt with in the first place under Ch. XIV, Code of Criminal Procedure. The High Court held that the provisions of para. 486 of the Police Regulations had not been observed and that the proceedings taken under section 7 of the Police Act were invalid and illegal and accordingly quashed the order of dismissal. The appellant contended (i) that the complaint did not make out any cognizable offence against the respondent and r. I of Para. 486 was not applicable in this case, (ii) that r. III of Para. 486 enabled the authorities to initiate departmental proceedings without complying with the provisions of r. I, (iii) that the Police Regulations made in exercise of the power conferred on the Government under the Police Act delegating the power of the Governor to dismiss at pleasure to a subordinate officer were only administrative directions for the exercise of the pleasure in a reasonable manner and any breach of the regulations did not confer any right or give a cause of action to the public servant, and (iv) that the regulations were only directory and the non compliance with the rules did not invalidate the order of dismissal. 680 Held, (per Sarkar, Subba Rao and Mudholkar, JJ.) that the order of dismissal was illegal as it was based upon an enquiry held in violation of r. I of Para 486 of the Police Regulations. The facts alleged in the complaint made out a cognizable offence under section 405 Indian Penal Code against the respondent, and the provisions of r. I of Para . 486 were applicable to it. A Police Officer making a search of a person was 'entrusted ' with the money handed over by the person searched. Rule III of Para. 486 did not deal with cognizable offences, it dealt with offences falling only under section 7 Police Act and to non cognizable offences. Rule III did not provide an alternative procedure to that prescribed under r. I. The position with regard to the tenure of public servants and to the taking of disciplinary action against them under the present Constitution was as follows: (i) Every person who was a member of a public service described in article 310 of the Constitution held office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor. (ii) The power to dismiss a public servant at pleasure was outside the scope of article I54 and, therefore, could not be delegated by the Governor to a subordinate officer, and could be exercised by him only in the manner prescribed by the Constitution. (iii) This tenure was subject to the limitations or qualifi cations mentioned in article 311. (iv )Parliament or the Legislature of States could not make a law abrogating or modifying this tenure so as to impinge upon the overriding power conferred upon the President or the Governor under article 310, as qualified by article 311. (v) Parliament or the Legislatures of States could make a law regulating the conditions of service of such a member which included proceedings by way of disciplinary action, without affecting the powers of the President or the Governor under article 310 read with article 311. (vi) Parliament and the Legislatures also could makea law laying down and regulating the scope and content of the doctrine of ""reasonable opportunity"" embodied in article 311 but the said law was subject to judicial review. (vii) If a statute could be made by Legislatures within the foregoing permissible limits, the rules made by an authority in exercise of the power conferred thereunder would likewise be efficacious within the said limits.

Subsequently on May 31, 1950, the Maharaja directed his banker in Bombay to pay A a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs out of the amount lying to his credit and when he was asked for instructions as to how that sum was to be entered in the books of account he passed an order on December 27, 1950, to the effect that in consideration of A having rendered loyal and meritorious services the said sum was given to him as a gift and that the amount should be debited to his personal expense account. The liability of the above sum for income tax was raised during the course of the assessment proceedings of A for the year 1951 52, and the assessee produced a letter dated March 10, 1953, written by the Maharajah at the request of the former, as follows: ""I confirm that in June 1950, I gave you a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs which was a gift as a token of my affection and regard for you and your family. . The Income tax Officer held that the amount was liable to income tax under section 7(1), read with explanation (2), of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922. The Appellate Tribunal took into account the two documents dated December 27, 1950, and March 10, 1953, written by the Maharajah and considered that the first which clearly mentioned why the said sum was paid to the assessee, was more reliable for the reason that it was contemporaneous, than the second which was written more than 2 years later and the correctness of which they were not inclined to accept. The Tribunal agreed with the Income tax Officer that the amount was a taxable receipt. Held, (per Kapur and Shah, JJ.; Hidayatullah, J., dissenting), that on the facts of the case the sum of Rs. 5 lakhs was given to the assessee not as a payment in consideration of the services already rendered by him as the Dewan of the State, but merely as a gift in token of the Maharajah 's affection and regard for the assessee, and, therefore, was not liable to be assessed to tax 743 under section 7(1), explanation (2), of the Indian Income tax Act,1922. The Tribunal was in error in treating the document dated December 27, 1950, 'as a contemporaneous document while as a matter of fact it was written six months after the fact of payment, and because of this erroneous approach as a result of which the second letter had been rejected, the finding given by the Tribunal could not be treated as binding on the Court. P. Krishna Menon vs The Commissioner of Income tax, Mysore, Travancore Cochin and Coorg, Bangalore, [1959] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 133, distinguished. Per Hidayatullah, J.

33,"In order to put the sugar industry on a stable footing, for which it was necessa",police_related,"In order to put the sugar industry on a stable footing, for which it was necessary to develop the cane area, the Ruler of the erstwhile Gwalior State by an order dated 27 7 1946 sanctioned the levy of cess of one anna per maund on all sugar cane purchased by the respondent company. When the Government of Madhya Bharat, which was the successor state of the former Gwalior State, made a demand for payment of the cess, the respondent filed a petition before the High Court of Madhya Bharat challenging the legality of the levy on the grounds (1) that the order dated 27 7 1946 was only an executive order and not a law under article 265 of the Constitution of India and that, therefore, there was no authority for the imposition of the cess after January 26, 1950, and (2) that the levy was discriminatory and violated article 14 inasmuch as while the respondent was made liable to pay the cess the other sugar factories in the State were exempt.","It was found that at the time when cess was first levied there was no sugar factory in existence in the Gwalior State other than that of the respondent. Held, that (i) the Ruler of an Indian State was an absolute monarch in which there was no constitutional limitation to act in any manner be liked, he being the supreme legislature, the supreme judiciary and the supreme head of the executive. , Consequently, the order dated 27 7 1946 issued by the Ruler of Gwalior State amounted to a law enacted by him and became an existing law under article 372 of the Constitution of India. The levy of cess was therefore by authority of law within the meaning of article 265; Madhaorao Phalke vs The State of Madhya Bharat, ; , followed. (2) the levy of cess did not contravene article 14 because (a) the object was cane development in the particular area and a geographical classification based upon historical factors was a permissible mode of classification, and (b) a tax could not be struck down as discriminatory unless it was found that it was imposed with a deliberate intention of differentiating between 620 an individual and individual; and particularly, in the instant case, where when cess was first sought to be levied, there was no other sugar factory existing in the State.",,1957,

Hanif Quareshi vs The State of Bihar the Supreme Court held that a total ban on the slaughter of bulls, bullocks and she buffaloes after they had ceased to be useful was not in the interests of the general public and was invalid.","Thereafter, the Bihar Legislature passed the Bihar Preservation and Improvement of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1958, the Uttar Pradesh Legislature passed the U. P. Prevention of Cow Slaughter (Amendment) Act, 1958 and the Madhya Pradesh Legislature passed a new Act, the M. P. Agricultural Cattle Preservation Act, 1959. Section 3 of the Bihar Act prohibited the slaughter of a bull, bullock or she buffalo except when it was over 25 years of age and had become useless. Rule 3 of the Bihar Preservation and Improvement of Animals Rules, 1960 prescribed that the certificate for slaughtering an animal could be granted only with the concurrence of the Veterinary Officer and the Chairman or Chief Officer of a District Board, Municipality etc., and if the two differed, then according to the decision of the Sub Divisional Animal Husbandary Officer. Section 3 of the U. P. Act permitted the slaughter of a bull or bullock only if it was over 20 years of age and was permanently unfit. It further provided that the animal could not be slaughtered within 20 days of the grant of 'a certificate that it was fit to be slaughtered and gave a right of appeal to any person aggrieved by the order granting the certificate. Section 4(1)(b) of the Madhya Pradesh Act provided that no bull, bullock or buffallo could be slaughtered except upon a certificate issued by the competent authority and section 4(2)(a) provided that no certificate could be issued unless the animal was over 20 years of age and was unfit for work or breeding. Section 4(3) gave a right of appeal to any person aggrieved by the order of the competent authority. Section 5 provided that no animal 611 shall be slaughtered within 10 days of the date of the issue of the certificate and where an appeal was preferred against the grant of the certificate, till the time such appeal was disposed of. The petitioners, who carried on the profession and trade of butchers, contended that the various provisions of the three Acts set out above infringed their fundamental rights by practically putting a total ban on the slaughter of bulls, bullocks and she buffaloes even after the animal had ceased to be useful and thus virtually put an end to their profession and trade. Held, (i) that the ban on the slaughter of bulls, bullocks and she buffaloes below the age of 20 or 25 years was not a reasonable restriction in the interests of the general public and was void. A bull, bullock or buffalo did not remain useful after 15 years, and whatever little use it may have then was greatly offset by the economic disadvantages of feeding and maintaining unserviceable cattle. The additional condition that the animal must, apart from being above 20 or 25 years of age, also be unfit was a further unreasonable restriction. Section 3 of the Bihar Act, section 3 of the U. P. Act and section 4(2)(a) of the M. P. Act were invalid. (ii) Rule 3 of the Bihar Rules was bad as it imposed dis proportionate restrictions on the rights of the petitioners. The procedure involved such expenditure of money and time as made the obtaining of the certificate not worthwhile. (iii) The provisions in the Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh Acts providing that the animal shall not be slaughtered within 20 and10 days respectively of the issue of the certificate and that any person aggrieved by the order of the competent authority, may appeal against it, were likely to hold up the slaughter of the animal for a long time and practically put a total ban on slaughter of bulls, bullocks and buffaloes even after they had ceased to be useful. These provisions imposed unreasonable restrictions on the fundamental rights of the petitioners and were void. Mohd. Hanif Quareshi vs The State of Bihar, [1959] S.C.R. 629, State of Madras vs V. G.

Subsequently on May 31, 1950, the Maharaja directed his banker in Bombay to pay A a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs out of the amount lying to his credit and when he was asked for instructions as to how that sum was to be entered in the books of account he passed an order on December 27, 1950, to the effect that in consideration of A having rendered loyal and meritorious services the said sum was given to him as a gift and that the amount should be debited to his personal expense account. The liability of the above sum for income tax was raised during the course of the assessment proceedings of A for the year 1951 52, and the assessee produced a letter dated March 10, 1953, written by the Maharajah at the request of the former, as follows: ""I confirm that in June 1950, I gave you a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs which was a gift as a token of my affection and regard for you and your family. . The Income tax Officer held that the amount was liable to income tax under section 7(1), read with explanation (2), of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922. The Appellate Tribunal took into account the two documents dated December 27, 1950, and March 10, 1953, written by the Maharajah and considered that the first which clearly mentioned why the said sum was paid to the assessee, was more reliable for the reason that it was contemporaneous, than the second which was written more than 2 years later and the correctness of which they were not inclined to accept. The Tribunal agreed with the Income tax Officer that the amount was a taxable receipt. Held, (per Kapur and Shah, JJ.; Hidayatullah, J., dissenting), that on the facts of the case the sum of Rs. 5 lakhs was given to the assessee not as a payment in consideration of the services already rendered by him as the Dewan of the State, but merely as a gift in token of the Maharajah 's affection and regard for the assessee, and, therefore, was not liable to be assessed to tax 743 under section 7(1), explanation (2), of the Indian Income tax Act,1922. The Tribunal was in error in treating the document dated December 27, 1950, 'as a contemporaneous document while as a matter of fact it was written six months after the fact of payment, and because of this erroneous approach as a result of which the second letter had been rejected, the finding given by the Tribunal could not be treated as binding on the Court.

On appeal with the certificate of the High Court, Held, that by virtue of section 44 and other provisions of the Income Tax Act a partner of a dissolved partnership firm may not only be made liable to assessment for income tax for the accounting years but despite dissolution of the firm he may be made liable to pay penalty for concealing the income of the firm under section 28(1)(c) of the Act.

The question for determination in the appeal was whether the appellants who had been refused exemption and were assessed to tax, could claim exemption under the Act. Held, that the question must be answered in the negative. Section 5 of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939, pro perly construed, leaves no manner of doubt that an exemption from assessment thereunder is clearly conditional upon the observance by the assessee of the conditions and restrictions imposed by the Act, either in the rules or in the license itself, and the words 'subject to ' used by the section means ""conditional upon"".

The appellant then applied for a reference to the High Court under section 66(1) of the Indian Income tax Act, and by its order dated December 10, 1952, the Tribunal referred the following question for the decision of the High Court. "" Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the profits and gains in respect of the sales made to the Government 211 of India were received by the assessee in the taxable terri tories ?"" The High Court remanded the case to the Tribunal for a supplemental statement of case calling for a finding on the question "" whether the cheques were sent to the assessee firm by post or by hand and what directions, if any, had the assessee firm given to the department in the matter "". The appellant questioned the order of the High Court relying on the decision in New Jehangir Vakil Mill 's case; , Held, that the enquiry in such cases must be to see whether the question decided by the Tribunal admits of the consideration of the new point as an integral or an incidental part thereof. The supplemental statement which the Tribunal is directed to submit must arise from the facts admitted and/or found by the Tribunal and should not open the door to fresh evidence. Held, further, that the question as framed in this case was wide enough to include an enquiry into whether there was any request, express or implied, that the amount of the bills be paid by cheques so as to bring the matter within the dicta of this Court in the Ogale Glass Works case, [1955] 1 S.C.R. 185 or Jagdish Mills case; , In the absence of anything expressly said in the Order of the High Court to the contrary, it cannot be held that the direction given would lead inevitably to the admitting of fresh evidence as that has been prohibited by the New Jehangir Vakil Mills case.

47,"In order to put the sugar industry on a stable footing, for which it was necessa",police_related,"In order to put the sugar industry on a stable footing, for which it was necessary to develop the cane area, the Ruler of the erstwhile Gwalior State by an order dated 27 7 1946 sanctioned the levy of cess of one anna per maund on all sugar cane purchased by the respondent company. When the Government of Madhya Bharat, which was the successor state of the former Gwalior State, made a demand for payment of the cess, the respondent filed a petition before the High Court of Madhya ,Bharat challenging the legality of the levy on the grounds (1) that the order dated 27 7 1946 was only an executive order and not a law under article 265 of the Constitution of India and that, therefore, there was no authority for the imposition of the cess after January 26, 1950, and (2) that the levy was discriminatory and violated article 14 inasmuch as while the respondent was made liable to pay the cess the other sugar factories in the State were exempt.","It was found that at the time when cess was first levied there was no sugar factory in existence in the Gwalior State other than that of the respondent. Held, that (i) the Ruler of an Indian State was an absolute monarch in which there was no constitutional limitation to act in any manner he liked, he being the supreme legislature, the supreme judiciary and the supreme head of the executive. I Consequently, the order dated 27 7 1946 issued by the Ruler of Gwalior State amounted to a law enacted by him and became an existing law under article 372 of the Constitution of India. The levy of cess was therefore by authority of law within the meaning of article 265; Madhaorao Phalke vs The State of Madhya Bharat, ; , followed. (2) the levy of cess did not contravene article 14 because (a) the object was cane development in the particular area and a geographical classification based upon historical factors was a permissible mode of classification, and (b) a tax could not be struck down as discriminatory unless it was found that it was imposed with a deliberate intention of differentiating between 620 (ii) where the order is passed by the Sub divisional Animal Husbandry Officer, under sub rule (5), to the District Animal Husbandry Officer and (iii) where the order is passed by the authority prescribed under sub rule (1) to the Sub divisional Animal Husbandry Officer, if there is one; if not, to the District Animal Husbandry Officer; (b) The appeal shall not be decided against the appellant unless he has been given a reasonable opportunity of being heard. "" The argument on behalf of the petitioners is that they are ""Kassais"" by profession and they earn their living by slaughtering cattle only (not goats or sheep which are slaughtered by ""Chiks""); that they have the fundamental right to carry on their profession and trade; and that section 3 of the Act read with r. 3 imposes unreasonable restrictions restrictions not in the interests of the general public on their fundamental right and therefore they are not saved by cl. (6) of article 19 of the Constitution. Some of these arguments were considered by this Court in Md. Hanif Quareshi vs The State of Bihar (1) and it was pointed out that the test of reasonableness should be applied to each individual statute impugned and no abstract standard, or general pattern, of reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all cases. It referred to the decision in State of Madras vs V. G. Row (2) and repeated what was said therein that ""the nature of the right alleged to have been infringed, the underlying purpose of the restrictions imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, the prevailing conditions at the time, should all enter into the judicial verdict."" 'Another consideration which has to be kept in mind is that ""the legislature is the best judge of what is good for the community,. by whose suffrage it comes into existence. . . . (See The State of Bihar vs Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga (3)). But the ultimate responsibility for determining the validity of the law must rest with the (1) (2) ; (3) 621 Court and the Court must not shirk that solemn duty cast on it by the Constitution. We must, therefore, approach the problem before us in the light of the principles laid down by this Court. The most pertinent question is having regard to all the relevant circumstances, is the age of 25 years laid down in section 3 a reasonable restriction on the right of the petitioners in the interests of the general public ? We are unable to say that it is. Apart from the affidavits made on behalf of the petitioners and the respondent State, a large volume of authoritative and expert opinion has been placed before us which shows beyond any doubt that a bull, bullock or she buffalo does not remain useful after 14 or 15 years and only a few of them live up to the age of 25. In the Report of the Cattle Preservation and Development Committee, published by the Ministry of Agriculture, it is recommended by the Committee that the slaughter of animals over 14 years of age and unfit for work as also animals of any age permanently unable to work owing to injury or deformity, should be allowed. In the Report on the Marketing of Meat in India (published by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture) there is a reference to a draft Bill circulated by the Ministry of Agriculture (page 112 of the Report) which contains a clause that animals over 14 years of age and unfit for work may be slaughtered on a certificate from a Veterinary Officer. In the Report on the Marketing of Cattle in India, again published by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, occurs the following passage as to the price of animals with reference to their age: ""Young draught animals up to the age of 4 years being raw and untrained fetch comparatively low prices. Between 4 and 8 years of age, the animals are in the prime of their youth and tender best service, and fetch maximum prices. From the 8th year onwards old age sets in, and a graded decline is observed in their capacity to work and consequently prices depreciate considerably."" . In a Food and Agricultural Organisation study of cattle in India and Pakistan (Zebu Cattle of India and 79 622 Pakistan, page 94) it is stated that the active breeding life of a bull is estimated to be about 10 years. In Black 's Veterinary Dictionary (edited by W. C. Miller and G. P. West, fifth edition) it is stated that pedigree ,bulls may reach 12 or 14 years of age before being discarded; and cattle seldom live longer than 15 or 16 years, and when they do, their age is usually of no immediate importance. In another publication of the Ministry of Agriculture called 'Problems of Cattle Insurance ' under Indian conditions, it is stated that the life of cattle is comparatively much shorter, the maximum age being only about 15 years. There is an interesting chart relating to the determination of age in cattle in a publication called 'Cattle Development in Uttar Pradesh ' by R. L. Kaura, Director of Animal Husbandry; that chart shows that at II years incisors appear smaller due to wearing out; at 12 years space appears between the teeth, and after 12 teeth wear out constantly and roots remain far apart from one another. As against all this expert opinion the respondent State has relied on the chart embodying some useful data about domestic animals, prepared by Major A. C. Aggarwala, Director of Veterinary Services, Punjab, and R. R. Gulati, Superintendent, Veterinary Department, Jullandur, which shows the sterility age of a buffalo at 15 and average age at 25, and of a cow sterility at 15 and 16 years and average life 22 years.",,1958,
48,One of the persons who entered into a partnership was a minor and in the instrum,police_related,One of the persons who entered into a partnership was a minor and in the instrument of partnership he was described as a full partner with equal rights and obligations with the other adult partners. The deed of partnership which was signed by the minor was produced before th e Registrar of Firms f or registration and he granted a certificate showing the minor as a full partner and not as one entitled merely to the benefits of the partnership.,"The Income tax Officer, however, refused to register the firm under section 26A of the Indian Income tax Act and his decision was upheld by the Income tax Authorities and the Income tax Appellate Tribunal. The High Court differed from the Tribunal and held that the firm should be registered. On appeal by the Commissioner of Income tax, Held, that the Rules framed under section 26A quite clearly show that a minor who is admitted to the benefits of partnership need not sign the application for registration. The law requires all partners to sign the application, and if the definition were to be carried to the extreme, even a minor who is admitted to the benefits of partnership would be competent to sign such an application. The definition is designed to confer equal benefits upon the minor by treating him as a partner; but it does not render a minor a competent and full partner. For that purpose, the law of Partnership must be considered, apart from the definition in the Income tax Act. Section 30 of the Indian Partnershi Act clearly lays down that a minor. cannot become a partner, I tough with the consent of the adult. .partners, he may be admitted to the benefits of partnership. . .Any document which goes beyond this section cannot be regarded as valid for the purpose of registration.

50,The respondents filed a suit for specific performance against the appellant whic,police_related,"The respondents filed a suit for specific performance against the appellant which was dismissed on March 12, 1954. On March 24 the respondents made an application for a certified copy of the judgment and decree.","The decree was not drawn up and the respondents were supplied a certified copy of the judgment and the memo of costs. The respondents filed an appeal before the High Court without the certified copy of the decree and only with the certified copy of the judgment and the memo of costs. The appeal was admitted under 0. 41, r. 11 Code of Civil Procedure on August 30, 1954. On December 23, 1958, the appellant served a notice on the respondents that he would raise a preliminary objection at the hearing that the appeal was incompetent as a certified copy of the decree was not filed as required by 0. 41, r. 1. On December 24, 1958, the respondents moved the trial Court for drawing up of the decree, but since the record was in the High Court this could not be done. At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant raised the preliminary objection, but the High Court passed an order on December 15, 1959, allowing the respondents one month 's time for getting a decree drawn up and obtaining. a copy and directed the record to be sent to the trial Court. Against this order the appellant preferred an appeal to the Supreme Court contending that the High Court was bound to dismiss the appeal as it was manifestly incompetent under 0. 41, r. 1. Subsequently, on December 23, 1959, the respondents obtained a certified copy of the decree and filed it before the High Court the same day. The appellant contended that the appeal was to be deemed to be filed on this date and was time barred. Held, that in the circumstances of this case the order passed by the High Court was right. ' There was no doubt that 0. 41, r. 1 was mandatory and in the absence of or the decree the filing of the appeal was incomplete, defective and incompetent. The office of the trial Court was negligent in not drawing up a decree and the office of the High Court was also not as careful as it should have been in examining the appeal and these have contributed substantially to the unfortunate position. In such a case, the respondents deserved to be protected. Besides the, 919 question had become academic and technical in view of subse quent events. The certified copy of the decree was filed on December 23, 1959, and even if the appeal was considered to have been filed on that date, it was within time. Under section 12(2) of the Limitation Act the respondents could treat the time taken in the drawing up of the decree after the application for a certified copy thereof had been made as part of the time taken in obtaining the certified copy of the decree.
